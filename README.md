# Brinkley Game
I AM LANCE SCHOENRADT
YO WHADDUP!?

Welcome to my game about John Romulus Brinkley. In this game you will play as "Dr." Brinkley and be able to relive his very strange life, or change it up a little bit.

Why I deserve an A:
This game contains valuable info about how Brinkley changed the radio world forever with his malpractice in goat testical transplants. You will get shot down by congress if you advertize your goat surgeries.
Also this is a pretty high effort game! I used a ton of varriables and fancy computer stuff, and all sorts of lil secrets I hope to be able to show off during my presentaion!
